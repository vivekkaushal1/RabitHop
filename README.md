# RabitHop
There is a rabbit (or other hopping animal you can draw) at the bottom of a set of stairs. The rabbit can hop up one step at a time to reach the top, or he can hop up two steps at a time. How many different combinations of hops are there for n steps. Write an algorithm to calculate the number of hop combinations for n steps.

Example - 4 steps

1-1-1-1 = 4 2-1-1 = 4 1-2-1 = 4 1-1-2 = 4 2-2 = 4

So for 4 steps, there are 5 possible different combinations of 1-2 hops to reach the top.
